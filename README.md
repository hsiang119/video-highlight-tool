### Future Extensions
- If the video generation platform requires a component library in the future, we will use shadcn/nuxt + Tailwind CSS to create components. Shadcn provides component behavior and functionality, while styles are handled with Tailwind CSS
- For complex pages in the future, we will implement additional Layout components as needed
- Add **[nuxt-security](https://nuxt.com/modules/security)** library to address OWASP Top 10 security concerns
